# CI/CD Setup Complete - Atlas Codex

## Setup Completed on 2025-09-04

### What We've Accomplished

#### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline âœ…
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with multi-environment support
- Tests run on every push and PR
- Automatic deployments configured for main and production branches
- Uses Serverless v3 to avoid authentication issues

#### 2. GitHub Secrets Configured âœ…
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  
- OPENAI_API_KEY (retrieved from Lambda)
- DEV_MASTER_API_KEY: `dev-e41d8c40f0bc54fcc590dc54b7ebe138344afe9dc41690c38bd99c838116405c`
- PROD_MASTER_API_KEY: `prod-28d4434781ec4cef8b68b00a8e84a6f49d133aab1e605504604a088e33ac97f2`

#### 3. Branch Structure âœ…
- `main` branch â†’ Development environment
- `production` branch â†’ Production environment (created)
- Both branches have protection rules

#### 4. GitHub Environments âœ…
- **development**: No restrictions, deploys from main
- **production**: Requires approval, deploys from production branch

#### 5. Branch Protection Rules âœ…
- **main**: Requires PR, status checks, 1 reviewer
- **production**: Requires PR, status checks, 2 reviewers, admin enforcement

## Deployment Flow

### Development Deployment
```bash
git checkout main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature"
git push origin main
# Automatic deployment to dev starts
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
git checkout production
git merge main
git push origin production
# Automatic deployment with canary release
```

## Monitoring

- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/coreydylan/atlascodex/actions

- Prod API: Coming soon after first production deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Vercel Setup** (Optional)
   - Run: `bash scripts/setup-vercel.sh`
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Environment variables will be set automatically

2. **First Production Deployment**
   - Merge main to production branch
   - Watch canary deployment (10% traffic for 2 min)
   - Auto-rollback if errors detected
