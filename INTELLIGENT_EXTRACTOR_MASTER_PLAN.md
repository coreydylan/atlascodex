# Atlas Codex Intelligent Data Extractor - Master Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan addresses the malformed JSON output issue and implements a fully adaptive natural language extraction system with beautiful, dynamic UI generation.

## Current Problem
- Extraction returns malformed JSON arrays instead of clean structured objects
- UI renders raw JSON.stringify() output instead of beautiful cards
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'skills_used')` error crashes pipeline
- Data structure inconsistency between extraction and UI rendering

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Start with Phase 1 (critical fixes) - these are blocking issues
- Phase 2-3 can be developed in parallel after Phase 1
- Phase 4 (UI) can begin once clean JSON structure is guaranteed
- Each task should include unit tests and integration tests

### File Organization
- Keep existing architecture - it's well-designed
- Add new components in `/packages/frontend/src/components/ui/`
- Extend skills in existing skill registry
- Document changes in each affected file

### Testing Strategy
- Use VMOTA people page as primary test case
- Add diverse test cases for different content types
- Automated testing for regression prevention
- Manual UX testing for interface quality
