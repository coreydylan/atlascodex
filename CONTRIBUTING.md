### üîß Code Contributions

#### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   ```
7. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"
   ```
8. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
9. **Create a Pull Request** to the `develop` branch

#### Coding Standards

**JavaScript/TypeScript Style:**
- Use TypeScript for new code when possible
- Follow existing code patterns in each package
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use Zod schemas for data validation

**Code Examples:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: TypeScript with proper typing
interface ExtractionResult {
  data: Record<string, unknown>;
  confidence: number;
  model: string;
}

async function extractData(url: string): Promise<ExtractionResult> {
  // Implementation
}

// ‚úÖ Good: JSDoc for public functions
/**
 * Extracts structured data from a webpage using GPT-5
 * @param url - The webpage URL to extract from
 * @param schema - JSON schema defining expected output
 * @returns Promise resolving to extraction result
 */
export async function extractStructuredData(
  url: string, 
  schema: JsonSchema
): Promise<ExtractionResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Git Commit Convention:**

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```bash
feat: add GPT-5 context caching for cost optimization
fix: resolve worker hanging on large document synthesis
docs: update API reference with new extraction parameters
```

#### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific package tests
cd packages/core && npm test
cd packages/worker && npm test
```

**Integration Tests:**
```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-key" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

**Required for Pull Requests:**
- All existing tests must pass
- New functionality must include tests
- Test coverage should not decrease significantly
- Manual testing instructions in PR description

2. Include detailed reproduction steps
3. Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

### Security Guidelines

When contributing:
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## üéØ Specialized Contributions

### GPT-5 Integration

When working on GPT-5 features:

- **Parameter Usage**: Use only supported parameters (`verbosity`, `reasoning_effort`)
- **Cost Optimization**: Implement context caching where possible
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Model Selection**: Use appropriate model tier for task complexity

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper GPT-5 integration
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5-nano',
  verbosity: 'low',
  reasoning_effort: 'minimal',
  response_format: {
    type: 'json_schema',
    json_schema: schema
  }
});
```

### Infrastructure Contributions

When working on deployment/infrastructure:

- Test changes in development environment first
- Include rollback procedures
- Document configuration changes
- Consider cost implications
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Frontend Contributions

For UI/UX contributions:

- Follow existing design patterns
- Ensure responsive design
- Add proper error handling
- Include loading states
- Test across different browsers

## üìä Performance Guidelines

### Cost Optimization

Atlas Codex prioritizes cost efficiency:

- **LLM Usage**: Keep below environment limits (15% in production)
- **Context Caching**: Structure prompts for maximum cache hits
- **Model Selection**: Use smallest appropriate model
- **Resource Management**: Clean up unused resources

### Response Time

Target performance metrics:

- **API Responses**: < 5 seconds for most requests
- **Simple Extraction**: 1-3 seconds with GPT-5-nano
- **Complex Analysis**: < 30 seconds with reasonable limits
- **Browser Rendering**: Optimize for sub-500ms startup
